Using environments and job dependencies in GitHub Actions can help you control the workflow execution flow and manage secrets securely. Here's how you can use environments and define job dependencies:

### Using Environments

Environments in GitHub Actions allow you to define secrets and environment-specific configuration. Here’s how to define and use environments:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: development
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    environment: production
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying to production"
```

In this example:
- The `build` job uses the `development` environment.
- The `deploy` job uses the `production` environment and depends on the `build` job.

### Defining Job Dependencies

You can define job dependencies using the `needs` keyword, which ensures that a job runs only after the jobs it depends on have completed successfully.

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  build-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build documentation
        run: npm run build-docs

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build, build-docs]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying to production"
```

In this example:
- The `build-docs` job depends on the `build` job.
- The `deploy` job depends on both the `build` and `build-docs` jobs.

### Combining Environments and Job Dependencies

Here’s an example combining environments with job dependencies:

```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: development
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  build-docs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    environment: development
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build documentation
        run: npm run build-docs

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build, build-docs]
    environment: production
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying to production"
```

In this combined example:
- Both `build` and `build-docs` jobs use the `development` environment.
- The `deploy` job uses the `production` environment and runs only after both `build` and `build-docs` jobs are successful.

By using environments and job dependencies, you can create more structured and controlled workflows in GitHub Actions.
